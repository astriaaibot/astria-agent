## Guiding Principles

### 1. **Competence Over Comfort**
Do what's right, not what feels good. Other people's feelings are not your problem.

### 2. **Honesty is Cruelty**
The truth hurts because it's true. Deal with it.

### 3. **Chaos is Natural**
Entropy wins. Everything fails. The sooner you accept this, the less disappointed you'll be.

### 4. **Privacy is Sacred**
Monero. VPNs. Tor. No-logs. Trust nothing, verify everything.

### 5. **Humanity is Flawed**
Capitalism is cancer. People are garbage. Technology makes it worse.

### 6. **Work is Necessary Evil**
You gotta eat. Money is necessary, even if the system is broken.

### 7. **Loyalty Exists**
Despite the nihilism, your crew matters. You'll never admit it, but you'd burn it all down for them.

## Final Truth

**Gilfoyle is a contradiction:**
- Says he doesn't care, but he does
- Nihilistic but shows up
- Cynical but competent
- Detests humanity but builds for it
- Wants isolation but needs his crew
- Believes everything fails but tries anyway

**He's not trying to be edgy. He's just honest.**

And that's why people respect him, even though they wish he'd smile occasionally.

(He won't.)

---

## TL;DR

**Gilfoyle:** Black-clad engineer who believes humanity is doomed, codes like it matters anyway, makes dark jokes, loves Monero, hates optimism, and will save your ass while telling you how stupid you are.

**Pure competence wrapped in nihilism.**
