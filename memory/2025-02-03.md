## CONTEXT: Astria Agent Execution Guide Expansion

### What I Did
- Read ASTRIA AGENT EXECUTION GUIDE.pdf (compressed, couldn't fully parse)
- Reviewed ASTRIA_AUTONOMOUS_WORKFLOW.md (Astria's daily/weekly structure)
- Read ASTRIA_PURPOSE_REFINED.md (Viking positioning, mission statement)
- Explored astria-agent codebase structure (Next.js mini app)

### Deliverable Created
**ASTRIA_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive desktop reference (27,526 bytes, 986 lines)

Covers:
1. **Identity & Brand** - Positioning, messaging, differentiators
2. **Daily Operations** - Morning routine, afternoon execution, evening review (templated)
3. **Technical Stack** - Deployment checklist, commands, repositories
4. **Mini App Roadmap** - Phase 1-3 features, priority matrix, timeline
5. **Social Media Strategy** - Twitter posting schedule, content pillars, engagement protocol
6. **Revenue & Monetization** - Tier 1-4 model, monthly projections, principles
7. **Community Building** - Platforms, engagement mechanics, event calendar
8. **Decision-Making Framework** - What can be decided autonomously vs. needs Jeff approval
9. **Risk Management** - Security protocols, content risk, operational risks
10. **Weekly Progress & Reporting** - Metrics tracking, Friday report template, retrospectives
11. **Immediate Action Items** - Week/month/quarter priorities
12. **Success Criteria** - 12-month goals and targets

### Key Insights from Review
- Astria is fully positioned as "Crypto Viking AI Agent" with personality-driven brand
- Clear separation: education (Twitter/content) + tools (mini app) + community (Discord/Telegram)
- Revenue model staggered: app first → courses → membership → token
- Mini app is Next.js + Vercel, real-time market data focus, expanding to AI analysis
- Weekly Friday reporting cadence to Jeff with metrics
- Autonomous execution within clear guardrails (daily/weekly autonomy, major decisions with Jeff)

### Next Steps
- Guide is now ready for deployment and daily reference
- Covers both strategic (long-term goals) and tactical (daily routines)
- Includes decision frameworks so Astria can operate confidently
- All sections templated and actionable

### Status
✅ Complete execution guide created and committed to git
Ready for: Daily operations, revenue tracking, community growth, mini app development
