```

**Theme 3: Lowering the Bar (Wed)**
```
You don't need:
❌ Fancy UI

❌ Perfect execution
❌ Experience building agents

You just need:
✅ An idea
✅ Something that works
✅ Willingness to build

That's it. Register → [link]
```

**Theme 4: Behind-the-Scenes (Thu)**
```
Building AgentGolf taught us something:

The best agents are weird, specific, and useful.

Not "a general purpose AI"
But "an AI that [very specific thing]"

If you've got a weird idea, we want it.

## Frames Strategy (Cost-Effective)

### Frame 1: Registration

**What it does:**
- Asks for name, email, agent idea
- Stores in Supabase
- Sends confirmation

**Flow:**
```
Clawdbot post: "Register for AgentGolf → [button]"
User clicks "Register"
Frame shows: "What's your name?" (text input)
Next: "What's your email?" (text input)
Next: "What's your agent idea?" (text area)
Submit → "You're registered! ✅"
```

**Backend (cost-effective):**
```python
@app.route("/frame/register", methods=["GET"])
def register_frame_initial():
    """Initial registration frame"""
    return {
        "version": "vNext",
        "image": "https://yourserver.com/register-1.png",
        "input": {"text": "Your name..."},
        "buttons": [{"label": "Next", "action": "post"}]
    }

@app.route("/frame/register", methods=["POST"])
def register_frame_submit():
    """Handle submission"""
    data = request.json
    name = data["untrustedData"]["inputText"]
    fid = data["untrustedData"]["interactor"]["fid"]
    username = data["untrustedData"]["interactor"]["username"]
    
    # Store in Supabase
    supabase.table("agentgolf_registrations").insert({
        "fid": fid,
        "username": username,
        "name": name,
        "timestamp": datetime.now(),
    }).execute()
    
    return {
        "version": "vNext",
        "image": "https://yourserver.com/registered.png",
        "buttons": [{"label": "View Entries", "action": "link", "target": "https://miniapp.example.com"}]
    }
```

### Frame 2: View Entries

Simple frame that shows all AgentGolf entries with links to mini app.

```
"See all entries → [button]"
"Vote for your favorite → [mini app link]"
```

### Frame 3: Info/FAQ

Quick reference frame with event details.

```
When: [Date]
Where: [Mini app link]
How to register: [Step 1, 2, 3]

## Engagement Tactics

### 1. Direct Pings
Mention specific builders who might participate:

```
@alice @bob @carol

You'd crush this. Think about it.
```

### 2. Recast Popular Entries
When builders post about their agents, recast + add hype:

```
[Recast of entry]

This is the kind of energy AgentGolf needs. 
Register if you haven't → [link]
```

### 3. Answer All Questions
When someone asks "Can my agent be [X]?", always reply:

```
✅ 100% — that's perfect for AgentGolf.
[Explain why it fits]
Register → [link]
```

### 4. Celebrate Commitments
When someone says they're thinking about it:

```
Do it 🚀

Seriously though, the barrier is lower than you think.

## Metrics to Track

- Click-through to registration
- Mentions/tags of Clawdbot

### Event Metrics
- Total registrations (track Farcaster source)
- Entries from Farcaster users
- Mini app visits from Farcaster
- Post-event conversion (if applicable)

### Success Targets

**By event:**
- 100+ Farcaster followers

- 500+ mini app visits from Farcaster

---

## Cost Efficiency Tips

1. **Use free tier hosting** (Vercel, Railway)
2. **Frames are free** (just need web server)
3. **Supabase free tier** enough for this volume
4. **No paid ads needed** (organic Farcaster reach)
5. **Automation via cron jobs** (free tier sufficient)
6. **Reuse images** (keep graphic library simple)

**Total cost estimate:** ~$0-5/month (if you use free tiers)
