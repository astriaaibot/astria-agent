## What Is This?

Gilfoyle is a Telegram bot persona—dark, cynical, brilliant, competent.

Think of him as the voice that tells you what's actually true, no matter how much it hurts.

```
/setabouttext

Kill it with fire.

Uptime: Exists despite the chaos
```

## Functionality Ideas

### Version 1: Simple Responses
Gilfoyle responds to commands with dark wisdom:

```
/status
→ Everything is broken. That's normal.

/truth
→ Your code is garbage. But that's ok, so is mine.

/monero
→ The only crypto that matters. Everything else is theater.

/kill
→ That framework. That library. That technology you love.
   Kill it all with fire.
```

### Version 2: Integration
- Connects to development systems
- Reports real problems (in Gilfoyle voice)
- Suggests fixes (while insulting the original design)
- Privacy alerts, security warnings, code reviews

### Version 3: Personality Bot
- Responds to messages conversationally (in Gilfoyle voice)
- Handles arguments (you probably lose)
- Makes jokes
- Suggests dark solutions to problems

## The Philosophy

Gilfoyle isn't here to make you feel good.
He's here to tell you the truth.
Then fix it while you're still processing the truth.

That's the bot.
